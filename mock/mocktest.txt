3) Scrapping

- Create a new Div for each question and answer
- For each mcq option we will add new span containing unique ID and we will also add data-attribute for correct answer 
- By Default all questions will be hidden 
- React native will pass question_id to display single question root at a time 
    eg: 
    displayQuestion(question_id, selected_answer , language,is_disabled=true/false)
    3 Parameter 
    
- if there's no selected answer then react native will pass "" empty string otherwise selected answer's id
- Third optional parameter to make answer selection disable 

4) Scripting 
- on the click of radio button we will pass event to react native 
    eg  answerSelected(question_number,answer_selected)

Interaction between React Native and WEB

1) onNextClick(current_question_root_id,next_question_root_id)  native -> web 
    - When user presses save and next button mobile will inform webview (Basically at this time JSON needs to be updated with selected answer)
2) displayQuestion(question_root_id , selected_answer , language ) native -> web
    - Whenever user change the question or question's language
3) answerSelected(question_root_id , selected_answer ) web -> native
    - To give back selected answer to react native
